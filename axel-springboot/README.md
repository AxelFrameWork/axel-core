# Axel Springboot files
These are the files we use to provide developers with a springboot runnable version of Axel.

The required files are added to a zip named axel-springboot.zip.

The files contained in the zip are
 - build.gradle
 - src/main/java/axel/AxelApplication.java
 - src/main/resources/application.yml
 - src/main/resources/log4j.properties
 - src/main/resources/spring-axel.xml
 
 To build change to axe-springboot folder and then "gradle clean build"
