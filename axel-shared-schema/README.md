# Axel Schemas
These are the schemas that describe the axel actions.

They also have the code to build the documentation output of the schemas.  This is
used to present the data in different formats (html, json, text)

The json format from ToJsonTest.java is used by the axel-tutorial to present schamas
from the output axel_core.json.  Axel builds the presentation from this json.
