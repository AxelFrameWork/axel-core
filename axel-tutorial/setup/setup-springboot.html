        <div class="pl-5">
	        <li>How to setup a gradle build script</li>

        The result of this action will replace the action content with the content of the page named <i>title.html</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        Now we have html components - on any page where you want to show the title you simply add this action.  The inserted page
        may also have axel actions which will be processed before the page is inserted.
    </p>
    <p class="test-justify">
        There are many actions that perform different tasks, the insert action is a simple instruction yet introduces the powerfull
        concept of html components in their native form.  The examples on this page show how to use the other actions and their benifits.
